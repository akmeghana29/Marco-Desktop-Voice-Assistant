This desktop voice assistant, Marco, is built using Python and follows a modular structure. The backend is developed with Flask to allow REST API integration in future updates. Voice input is captured using the SpeechRecognition library and processed using conditional logic. pyttsx3 is used for offline text-to-speech feedback. For actions like opening websites, YouTube playback, or sending WhatsApp messages, it integrates pywhatkit and webbrowser. Notes are saved locally as text files and can be read back using voice commands. The CLI interface is set up in cli.py to allow direct terminal execution. Each functionality is wrapped in functions inside marco.py, and routing support via routes.py prepares it for web integration. The assistant listens continuously in a loop until given an exit command. Itâ€™s lightweight, efficient, and built to feel like a personal digital companion.
